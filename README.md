# 🏡 Task 3: Linear Regression – Elevate Labs Internship

## 🎯 Objective
To implement and understand Simple Linear Regression using the Housing dataset, and evaluate the model's performance with key metrics.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Files Included
- `task3_linear_regression.ipynb` – Complete notebook for model training and evaluation
- `Housing.csv` – Dataset containing area and price
- `README.md` – This file

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Selected `'area'` as the independent feature and `'price'` as the target
3. Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20)
4. Trained a `LinearRegression` model using `scikit-learn`
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
6. Visualized the regression line over actual data

## 📈 Model Output
- 📉 MAE: *your_value*
- 📊 MSE: *your_value*
- 📈 R² Score: *your_value*

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- The model successfully predicts housing price based on area
- Positive linear relationship between area and price
- Linear regression is interpretable and fast for numeric prediction problems

## ✅ Status
✅ Task 3 successfully completed and submitted as part of the Elevate Labs AI/ML Internship.
